Speakers/Performers:  Julia Bullock; Laura Poe
Sponsor:  Cal Performances
Cal Performances audiences know the superb, daring soprano Julia Bullock well, from her 2018 Hertz Hall recital, and before that, in her star turns as both Josephine Baker and French mystic and activist Simone Weil at the 2016 Ojai at Berkeley festival. Just before this springs lockdown, Bullock visited the Bay Area to sing with the San Francisco Symphony, where the San Francisco Chronicle praised the dramatic power and clarity of her interpretations, and her ability to plunge unnervingly deep into this music and then surface, like some kind of musical pearl diver, with great glistening strands of expressive jewels. Recording this recital from her home city of Munich, Bullock presents one of her characteristically diverse and thoughtfully curated programs, traversing art song, contemporary works, and selections from African-American jazz and blues.

Following the premiere, this performance will be available to view on demand for three months until April 14, 2021.
Target audience:  All Audiences
Open to audience:  All Audiences
Tickets required: $15 for a single viewer, $30 for two viewers, and $60 per household viewing. $5 tickets are available for UC Berkeley students.

Details of the original alert: 

 

 -  WHAT: Forecast highs from the 90s to 105 F in the interior North Bay and East Bay. Overnight lows will be in the 60s and 70s in the hills, so expect little overnight relief. These will be some of our hottest temperatures of the year thus far.

 -  WHEN: Until 9 PM PDT Monday.

249,,performing-arts,US,,"Mark Morris Dance Group and Philharmonia Baroque join forces once again in a revival of Jean-Philippe Rameau’s masterpiece Platée, the story of a homely yet vain nymph who falls prey to a prank set by the gods. This production, with costumes by Isaac Mizrahi, premiered at Zellerbach Hall in 1998. Platée was among the most highly regarded of Rameau’s operas during his lifetime, and it was even well received by the royal family who commissioned it—for the nuptials of the son of King Louis XV of France and Maria Theresa of Spain. In an act of comic genius, Rameau created the role of Platée to be sung by a (male) high tenor, here played by the French tenor Mathias Vidal. Morris’ choreography mixes high camp with supreme craft, the movement always sensitive to the richness of the effervescent Baroque score.

Platée was among the most highly regarded of Rameau’s operas during his lifetime, and it was even well received by the royal family who commissioned it—for the nuptials of the son of King Louis XV of France and Maria Theresa of Spain. In an act of comic genius, Rameau created the role of Platée to be sung by a (male) high tenor, here played by the French tenor Mathias Vidal.

Details of the original alert: 

 

 -  WHAT: Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying coastal locations across the San Francisco Bay shoreline during peak high tide through Monday.



 -  WHERE: Low lying portions of the San Francisco Bayshore. Localized impacts are also possible in low lying areas along the Pacific shore as well, such as near Elkhorn Slough. 


 -  WHEN: From 9 AM to 3 PM PST Tuesday.



 -  IMPACTS: Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads throughout the San Francisco Bay Shoreline with the highest high tides.



 -  ADDITIONAL DETAILS: Tidal levels are forecast to subside but rising seas due to building swell and storm surge will offset the differences during high tide on Tuesday. Thus, localized flooding of low lying coastal locations is possible again Tuesday from 9AM to 3PM.

Details of the original alert: 

 

 -  WHAT: Minor coastal flooding expected at prone low lying coastal locations across the San Francisco Bay shoreline during peak high tide through Monday.



 -  WHERE: Low lying portions of the San Francisco Bayshore. Localized impacts are also possible in low lying areas along the Pacific shore as well, such as near Elkhorn Slough. 


 -  WHEN: From 9 AM to 3 PM PST Tuesday.



 -  IMPACTS: Flooding of areas previously impacted by King Tide events is expected, including low lying lots, parks, and roads throughout the San Francisco Bay Shoreline with the highest high tides.



 -  ADDITIONAL DETAILS: Tidal levels are forecast to subside but rising seas due to building swell and storm surge will offset the differences during high tide on Tuesday. Thus, localized flooding of low lying coastal locations is possible again Tuesday from 9AM to 3PM. Check local tide forecasts for high tide times as these can vary and occur anywhere between mid morning to early afternoon.",,180,2022-01-03 22:00:00+00:00,2021-12-31 01:15:22+00:00,"{'geometry':
